Creating a fugue in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach is a complex task, as it requires an understanding of counterpoint, thematic development, and harmonic progression. Below is a simplified attempt to capture the essence of a Bach-style fugue in textual format. Please note that actual music notation would be necessary for a complete and precise representation.

**Subject:**

```
C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
```

**Exposition:**

1. **Voice 1 (Soprano)** enters with the Subject in C major:

   ```
   C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
   ```

2. **Voice 2 (Alto)** enters with the Answer in G major (dominant):

   ```
   G - A - B - C - D - E - F♯ - G
   ```

3. **Voice 3 (Tenor)** enters with the Subject in C major:

   ```
   C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
   ```

4. **Voice 4 (Bass)** enters with the Answer in G major:

   ```
   G - A - B - C - D - E - F♯ - G
   ```

**Development:**

- **Episode 1:** The voices engage in imitative counterpoint based on fragments of the Subject. Use sequences and modulate through related keys like A minor and E minor.

- **Middle Entries:** Reintroduce the Subject and Answer in various keys, such as A minor and E minor, with the voices entering in a different order. Incorporate stretto (overlapping entries of the subject).

**Recapitulation:**

- Return to the home key of C major. The Subject appears in all voices, now with more elaborate counterpoint and ornamentation.

**Coda:**

- Conclude with a final statement of the Subject in the tonic key, embellished with rapid scalar passages and a Picardy third (ending on a major chord).

Please note that without musical notation, this description is quite abstract. A true fugue would require precise notation of each voice, attention to rhythm, and detailed harmonic structure. For a fully realized fugue, consider consulting a music composer or using a music composition software.
