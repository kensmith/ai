Writing a complete fugue in the style of Bach is a complex task that requires careful attention to structure, thematic development, and counterpoint. Below, I will outline a fugue in the style of Bach, providing the main elements and a basic structure. This is a simplified version, but it should give you an idea of how a Bach-style fugue might be constructed.

**Title: Fugue in C Minor**

**Exposition:**

1. **Subject (S)**: The main theme of the fugue, presented in the tonic key (C minor).
   - Played by the alto voice.
   - Rhythm: Quarter note, eighth notes, quarter note.
   - Melody: C - D - Eb - G - F - Eb - C.

2. **Answer (A)**: The subject transposed to the dominant key (G minor).
   - Played by the soprano voice.
   - Rhythm: Same as the subject.
   - Melody: G - A - Bb - D - C - Bb - G.

3. **Countersubject (CS)**: A secondary theme that complements the subject and answer.
   - Played by the alto voice when the answer is introduced.
   - Rhythm: Eighth notes, quarter notes.
   - Melody: Eb - C - G - F - Eb - D - C.

4. **Subject (S)**: Reintroduced in the tonic key.
   - Played by the bass voice.
   - Rhythm: Same as the initial subject.
   - Melody: C - D - Eb - G - F - Eb - C.

**Development (Episodes and Entries):**

1. **Episode 1**:
   - Uses fragments of the subject and countersubject.
   - Modulates from C minor to E♭ major.
   - Voices: Soprano and alto engage in a dialogue using the subject fragments.

2. **Entry 1 (S)**:
   - Subject in E♭ major.
   - Played by the tenor voice.
   - Rhythm: Same as the initial subject.
   - Melody: Eb - F - G - Bb - Ab - G - Eb.

3. **Episode 2**:
   - Uses the countersubject and inverted subject fragments.
   - Modulates from E♭ major back to C minor.
   - Voices: Bass and soprano use inverted fragments in a dialogue.

4. **Entry 2 (A)**:
   - Answer in G minor.
   - Played by the alto voice.
   - Rhythm: Same as the initial answer.
   - Melody: G - A - Bb - D - C - Bb - G.

5. **Episode 3**:
   - Uses stretto (overlapping entries) of the subject and countersubject.
   - Stays in C minor.
   - Voices: All voices participate in the stretto.

**Final Section:**

1. **Entry 3 (S)**:
   - Subject in C minor.
   - Played by the soprano voice.
   - Rhythm: Same as the initial subject.
   - Melody: C - D - Eb - G - F - Eb - C.

2. **Coda**:
   - Uses fragments of the subject and countersubject.
   - Gradually resolves to a C minor chord.
   - Voices: All voices come together to form a final cadence.

This outline provides a basic structure for a fugue in the style of Bach. Each section would be further developed with intricate counterpoint, harmonic progressions, and thematic variations to create a complete piece. The actual composition would involve notating the music in a score, which is beyond the scope of this text-based response.
