Writing a full fugue in the style of Bach is a complex task that requires careful planning and execution. However, I can provide you with a brief example of the beginning of a fugue in Bach's style, including the exposition with the subject and answer, and a few episodes and entries. Here's a short fugue in D minor:

**Subject (in D minor, played by the soprano voice):**

```
D4 - E4 - F4 - G4 - A4 - Bb4 - C5 - D5
```

**Answer (in A minor, played by the alto voice):**

```
A3 - B3 - C4 - D4 - E4 - F4 - G4 - A4
```

**Countersubject (played by the soprano voice while the alto plays the answer):**

```
F4 - E4 - D4 - C4 - Bb3 - A3 - G3 - F3
```

**Second entry of the subject (in D minor, played by the tenor voice):**

```
D3 - E3 - F3 - G3 - A3 - Bb3 - C4 - D4
```

**Episode 1 (using motifs from the subject and countersubject, played by the soprano and alto voices):**

```
Soprano: D4 - E4 - F4 - E4 - D4 - C4 - Bb3 - A3
Alto:    A3 - B3 - C4 - B3 - A3 - G3 - F3 - E3
```

**Third entry of the subject (in A minor, played by the bass voice):**

```
A2 - B2 - C3 - D3 - E3 - F3 - G3 - A3
```

**Episode 2 (using motifs from the subject and countersubject, played by the alto and tenor voices):**

```
Alto:    F3 - E3 - D3 - E3 - F3 - G3 - A3 - G3
Tenor:   D3 - C3 - Bb2 - C3 - D3 - E3 - F3 - E3
```

This example provides the basic structure of a fugue's exposition and the beginning of the development section. In a full fugue, you would continue with more entries of the subject in different keys, more episodes, and possibly stretto, inversion, and augmentation of the subject. Bach's fugues often include complex counterpoint and intricate voice leading, which would be developed further in a complete piece.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and a true Bach fugue would be much more elaborate and nuanced. If you're interested in composing a full fugue, I recommend studying Bach's fugues in detail and practicing the techniques of counterpoint and voice leading.
