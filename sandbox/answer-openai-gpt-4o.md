Creating a fugue in the style of Bach is a complex task, especially when using the theme from the Musical Offering. Below is a basic structure for the fugue using LilyPond notation. This will give you both a PDF and MIDI output. Note that for an actual performance-ready piece, you'd need to refine and expand upon this initial framework.

```lilypond
\version "2.24.2" % specify the version to ensure compatibility

% Define the theme from the Musical Offering
theme = \relative c' {
  \key d \minor
  \time 4/4
  r4 a'8 b a g f e d
  \breathe
  d4 f8 e d c b a g
}

% Define a countersubject
countersubject = \relative c' {
  \key d \minor
  \time 4/4
  d8 f g a b g a f
  e d c b a g f e
}

% First voice
voiceOne = \relative c'' {
  \clef treble
  \theme
  \countersubject
  \bar "|."
}

% Second voice
voiceTwo = \relative c' {
  \clef alto
  \theme
  \countersubject
  \bar "|."
}

% Third voice
voiceThree = \relative c {
  \clef bass
  \theme
  \countersubject
  \bar "|."
}

\score {
  \new StaffGroup <<
    \new Staff = "treble" <<
      \set Staff.instrumentName = "Voice 1"
      \voiceOne
    >>
    \new Staff = "alto" <<
      \set Staff.instrumentName = "Voice 2"
      \voiceTwo
    >>
    \new Staff = "bass" <<
      \set Staff.instrumentName = "Voice 3"
      \voiceThree
    >>
  >>

  \layout { }
  \midi { }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Theme**: The theme is derived from the Musical Offering, keeping its essence.
- **Countersubject**: A simple countersubject is provided to interact with the theme.
- **Voices**: Three voices are structured to simulate the polyphonic texture typical of a Bach fugue.
- **StaffGroup**: Used to group the three staves together, maintaining the sense of a single piece.

This code provides a starting point for your fugue. You would need to develop it further, incorporating more sophisticated counterpoint techniques, episodes, stretto, and other fugal elements to capture the essence and complexity of a Bach fugue.
