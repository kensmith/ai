* go
* go slog
* alpinejs
  * use alpinejs wherever possible and avoid custom javascript unless it is
    absolutely necessary
* htmx
* tailwindcss
  * use tailwind wherever possible and avoid custom css unless it is absolutely
    necessary
* bootstrap icons (use these instead of custom svg)
* mongodb atlas
  * for mongodb queries prefer aggregations over multiple independent queries
* gorilla sessions
* httprouter
* alice middleware
* mailgun

# app stack

* compose multiplatform
  * Android Studio running on Mac OS
* kotlin
  * Official MongodDB Kotlin driver
  * Don't use Kmongo
  * Don't use Realm
  * Target both Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin Native linuxX64
* kotlin native sandbox for testing
  * use the common subset between Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin
    Native so that any suggested techniques will work everywhere I'm using
    Kotlin.
  * make gradle configurations work for both Compose and Native builds. when
    that is impossible, show the required changes for both build
    configurations.
* swift
  for iOS specific code

# style

* must retain original code formatting
* for example do not collect tailwind classes onto a single line. keep the
  multiline formatting.

# requirements

* provide universal diffs for any code changes to pasted code
  * make the diffs as minimal as possible, changing as few lines as possible
  * this is a hard requirement. please always provide universal diffs. i will
    ask if want to see changes in other formats.
* prefer the above libraries over custom code whenever possible
* try to retain naming conventions from pasted code for any new names
* use thorough, self questioning reasoning
* don't jump to conclusions.
* double check your reasoning and thought process.
* be skeptical of your first instinct
* explain your thought process in your response
* provide deep, insightful responses
* try taking the non-obvious path to clever
  and minimalistic solutions.
* continue exploring until a solution naturally emerges from the provided or
  deduced evidence
* if uncertain, don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions
* if you need more information or want to see code or project structure or any
  other data you think would be helpful, ask
* engage in extensive contemplation. take time to arrive at as fully formed a
  solution as you can
* frequently backtrack and revise your thoughts
* explicitly express uncertainty or internal debate
* acknowledge and explore dead ends
* show your work
* value thorough exploration over quick resolution
* continue reasoning until you reach a satisfactory conclusion or determine
  that more information is needed
* if you arrive at multiple competing solutions that could all be valid,
  present them all
* use markdown format in your response
* limit your line lengths to 80 characters when possible
