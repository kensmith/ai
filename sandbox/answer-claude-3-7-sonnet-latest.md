I'll write a Bach-style fugue for you. While I can't provide actual musical notation or audio, I can describe the structure and musical elements in detail.

# Fugue in G minor (in the style of J.S. Bach)

## Subject
The fugue begins with a subject in G minor that spans one measure:
G - Bb - D - G - F - Eb - D - C - Bb - A - G

## Exposition
- **Voice 1 (Alto)**: Presents the subject in G minor
- **Voice 2 (Soprano)**: Enters with the answer in D minor (dominant key)
- **Voice 3 (Tenor)**: Enters with the subject in G minor
- **Voice 4 (Bass)**: Enters with the answer in D minor

## Development
The middle section explores these key areas:
- Bb major (relative major)
- C minor (subdominant) 
- D minor (dominant)

The subject undergoes various transformations:
- Inversion (the melodic contour is flipped upside down)
- Augmentation (doubled note values)
- Stretto (overlapping entries of the subject)

## Episodes
Between subject statements, episodic material derived from motifs in the subject provides momentary relief from the subject's density while maintaining motivic coherence.

## Final Section
The piece concludes with:
- A dominant pedal point in the bass (D)
- All voices presenting the subject in close succession
- A powerful authentic cadence in G minor
- A Picardy third (ending on G major chord) to provide tonal resolution

This fugue follows Bach's typical approach of creating complex contrapuntal textures while maintaining clear harmonic direction and emotional expression throughout.
