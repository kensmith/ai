Creating a full fugue in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach is a complex task, as it involves multiple voices interweaving in a contrapuntal texture, following specific rules and structures. Below is an outline and a short example that captures the essence of a Bach fugue. For a complete fugue, it would typically consist of an exposition, development, and final entry.

### Fugue in C Minor

#### Subject
The subject is the main theme of the fugue and is typically presented in a single voice at the beginning.

```
Voice 1 (Soprano):
C - E♭ - F - G - A♭ - G - F - E♭ - D - C
```

#### Exposition
The exposition introduces the subject in each voice in turn, typically starting with the tonic (C minor) and answering in the dominant (G minor).

**Voice 1 (Soprano):**  
Begins with the subject in C minor.

**Voice 2 (Alto):**  
Answers with the subject transposed to G minor.

**Voice 3 (Tenor):**  
Presents the subject in C minor.

**Voice 4 (Bass):**  
Completes the exposition with the subject in G minor.

#### Development
The development section explores variations and modulations of the subject and countersubjects, moving through various keys and employing techniques such as inversion, diminution, and augmentation.

**Example of Development:**

- **Inversion:** The subject is inverted, turning ascending intervals into descending ones.
- **Diminution:** The rhythmic values of the subject are shortened.
- **Augmentation:** The rhythmic values of the subject are lengthened.

#### Final Entry
The fugue returns to the home key (C minor) and presents the subject in its original form, often with all voices entering in a climactic manner.

**Voice 1 (Soprano):**  
Returns with the subject in C minor.

**Voice 2 (Alto):**  
Enters with a countersubject in C minor.

**Voice 3 (Tenor):**  
Reintroduces the subject.

**Voice 4 (Bass):**  
Completes the fugue with a final statement of the subject.

### Example (Shortened Version)

```
Voice 1 (Soprano):
C - E♭ - F - G - A♭ - G - F - E♭ - D - C

Voice 2 (Alto):
G - B♭ - C - D - E♭ - D - C - B♭ - A - G

Voice 3 (Tenor):
C - E♭ - F - G - A♭ - G - F - E♭ - D - C

Voice 4 (Bass):
G - B♭ - C - D - E♭ - D - C - B♭ - A - G
```

This is a simplified example to illustrate the structure and progression of a fugue in Bach's style. Writing a full fugue involves careful planning and intricate counterpoint, which can be further developed with more detail and complexity.
