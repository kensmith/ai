Writing a fugue in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach is a complex task because it involves intricate counterpoint and thematic development. Below is a simplified version of a fugue that tries to capture the essence of Bach's style. I'll provide a piano score in text form, focusing on a three-voice fugue.

**Key: C minor**

**Subject:**
```
Voice 1 (Soprano): C - Eb - G - F - Eb - D - C
```

**Exposition:**

1. **Voice 1 (Soprano):** Introduce the subject.
   - C - Eb - G - F - Eb - D - C

2. **Voice 2 (Alto):** Answer in the dominant key (G minor), while Voice 1 continues with a countersubject.
   - G - Bb - D - C - Bb - A - G
   - Countersubject: Eb - G - Ab - G - F

3. **Voice 3 (Bass):** Enter with the subject in the tonic key, while Voice 2 continues the countersubject.
   - C - Eb - G - F - Eb - D - C
   - Countersubject: Bb - D - Eb - D - C

**Middle Section:**

1. **Development:** Modulate through related keys (e.g., Eb major, F minor) with episodes derived from the subject and countersubject.

2. **Episode 1:** 
   - Sequence using fragments of the subject:
   - Voice 1: Eb - D - C - Bb
   - Voice 2: G - F - Eb - D
   - Voice 3: C - Bb - Ab - G

3. **Return to Subject in Eb Major:**
   - Voice 1: Eb - G - Bb - Ab - G - F - Eb
   - Imitation in other voices.

4. **Episode 2:** Increase tension with stretto (overlapping entries of the subject).
   - Voice 1: F - Ab - C - Bb
   - Voice 2: Bb - D - F - Eb
   - Voice 3: Ab - C - Eb - D

**Final Section:**

1. **Return to Tonic (C minor):**
   - Restate the subject in original form in each voice.
   - Voice 1: C - Eb - G - F - Eb - D - C

2. **Coda:**
   - Conclude with a Picardy third (ending in C major).
   - Voice 1: C - D - Eb - F - G - C
   - Voice 2: E - F - G - A - Bb - C
   - Voice 3: G - A - Bb - C - D - G

This is a simplified version and does not capture the full complexity of a Bach fugue, which would typically involve more intricate counterpoint, modulations, and thematic transformations. To truly understand and write a fugue like Bach, studying his works, particularly "The Well-Tempered Clavier," is highly recommended.
